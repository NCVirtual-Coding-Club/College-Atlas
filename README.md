# College Atlas


According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there are over 6500 postsecondary institutions in the United States.  With the time, money, and effort spent on college, finding the right one is critical.  NC Virtual Coding Club will be developing an app called CollegeAtlas.  This app will allow students to better navigate through college choices as they pursue their postsecondary endeavors.  With CollegeAtlas, students will input their preferences by answering a series of questions and allowing the app to determine the best college(s) based on their responses. Most students find their schools by meeting with college advisors or spending hours searching the internet.  CollegeAtlas will be a solution for students who, like our coding club members, are on the go and pressed for time
